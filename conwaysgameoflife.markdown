# Conway's Game of Life
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project's purpose was to teach about cellular automata in general and specifically about Conway's Game of Life. It was made in QTCreator based on Model View Controller Architecture and was made within a group. It consists of three major pieces: the title screen which implemented Box2D to have a fun physics based screen involving bouncing balls and letters; the informative pages which explained to the user what cellular automata are, their importance, and the significance of Conway's Game of Life, along with its specific rules; and the main page which contained a space to mess around within Conway's Game of Life, save your current state, and several other features.
