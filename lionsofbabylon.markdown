# Lions of Babylon - Alternative Game 
<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J8y27IUYiwVeVGAYxLjonGAhEAyrCS-D/preview" style="border:none; padding: 1rem;" width="828rem" height="480rem" allowfullscreen = "allow" align="center"></iframe>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This game was made over several months with the goal of creating an alternative game focused on the Iraq War, as it is often underrepresented and forgotten about in current times. The game has two gameplay loops, starting with a decision making phase focused on changing your stats, and a strategy portion where you play as the nation of Iraq and attempt to defend against the US. I was the sole programmer on the team and helped inform several design and technical decisions.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first part of the game uses a dictionary and priority queue to order the decisions you make and retrieve the data corresponding to it. The development of the second half of the game presented much more of a challenge, as it required several complex algorithms and functions to be custom-made while working within the often strange syntax of Gamemaker. This meant I had to quickly learn the new systems and the potential causes for bugs in order to translate between the backend data structures and visual display, as well as run a depth limited breadth-first search. Another focus on this phase of development was making sure everything was easily understandable and editable for the designer on the team. This resulted in several simple templates being created so new units could quickly and easily be created without having understand the entire codebank, as well as making new levels in a manner that was intuitive and easy to use.
