# Wooden Block Castle - Unreal Engine Render
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project was to 3D model a castle scene in Unreal Engine 5 within 3 weeks. The project required work from within many different programs, such as Maya, ZBrush, Photoshop, and Unreal Engine. I initially designed the general layout in geoblocks within Unreal Engine loosely based on the design of Beaumaris Castle in Wales. The blocks and siege towers were modeled in Maya along with the creation of the UV's. Photoshop was used to edit the many textures used. The mannequins started from a basic default mannequin with me adding the helmet and sword in Maya, while texturing them in ZBrush. I also created the UV for the mannequins alongside rigging and animating them in Maya. The final piece was then assembled and rendered in Unreal Engine, with the lighting and atmospheric effects being added within.
