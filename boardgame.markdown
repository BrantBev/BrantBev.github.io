# Eurydice - Solo Board Game Project<!--Potentiall update to a mid physical play photo.-->
<img src ="/assets/images/boardgame/Tartarus.png" alt = "First Board of Eurydice" width = "300 rem" align = "left"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project is a singleplayer boardgame project I created, playtested, and iterated through to reach a fairly stable and complete final form. The game is based on the Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, in which Orpheus must guide Eurydice through Hades back to the surface without looking back at her. Based on this concept the game prominently features hidden information as a mechanic and makes the player traverse a variety of paths while curating the main deck (which is facedown) to include more heart cards than club cards, while attempting to avoid ever seeing spade cards, as these carry a heavy price with each sighting. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads to the player carefully weighing their odds and allows them to push their luck or go for a more reserved strategy, each with their own risks. It is also designed to allow the player to explore combos between the random effects which change with each play though and the standard mechanics, potentially allowing them to change the game state significantly. The game also went through a long playtesting cycle which kept the core concept alive but making it much more engaging for the player by adding choice and reducing the extreme variety the game had early on. The game also had multiple updates in the components used, such as the late addition of the playmat and significant choice to switch to cards instead of tokens in a bag. This change was about halfway through development and completely changed the feeling of the game as well as opened up completely new mechanics to explore.
